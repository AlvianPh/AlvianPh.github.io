        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Jawir Apps is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help
          users detect and recognize aksara through image scanning. The
          application focuses on delivering a modern, user-friendly interface
          while supporting features such as authentication, image scanning, and
          scan history management.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Many people experience difficulties in recognizing and identifying
          aksara correctly due to limited access to interactive and digital
          learning tools. Existing solutions are often not mobile-friendly or
          lack an intuitive user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Jawir Apps offers a mobile-based solution that allows users to scan
          aksara images using their smartphone camera or gallery. The
          application presents scan results clearly and stores scan history,
          making it easier for users to learn and review aksara recognition
          results.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          Through this project, I learned how to build a structured Flutter
          application, manage state and navigation, integrate REST APIs, and
          design a clean and user-friendly mobile interface. This project also
          improved my understanding of mobile UX principles and API-driven
          application development.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project also strengthened my experience in handling asynchronous
          data, file uploads, authentication tokens, and image-based features in
          Flutter applications.

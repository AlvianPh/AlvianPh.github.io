        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Kerti Kawista is a mobile application concept designed to support
          employee attendance and safety compliance monitoring in construction
          projects. The application focuses on ensuring that workers meet K3
          (Occupational Health and Safety) requirements before starting work,
          while also simplifying attendance recording for project management.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          In many construction projects, attendance recording and safety checks
          are still handled manually. This process is prone to human error,
          inefficient data recording, and lack of real-time monitoring of
          workers’ compliance with safety equipment standards.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          Kerti Kawista provides a mobile-based solution that combines employee
          attendance with K3 safety checks. The application allows workers to
          record attendance while verifying required safety equipment, and
          enables project managers to monitor compliance through a clear and
          structured interface.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          Through this project, I learned how to design a mobile application
          interface based on real-world operational needs, particularly in the
          construction industry. I improved my understanding of user-centered
          design, role-based user flows, and how UI/UX decisions can directly
          impact efficiency and safety compliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project also strengthened my ability to translate system
          requirements into clear visual designs and structured interaction
          flows that are easy to understand and use.

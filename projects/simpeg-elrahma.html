        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          SIMPEG El-Rahma is a web-based employee management system designed to
          help manage personnel data and official documents at STMIK El Rahma
          Yogyakarta. The system focuses on improving administrative efficiency
          by organizing employee information, documents, and workflows in a
          centralized digital platform.
        </p>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Employee data and document management were previously handled manually
          or using fragmented systems, making it difficult to track documents,
          ensure data consistency, and retrieve information efficiently. This
          often resulted in slow administrative processes and data redundancy.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
          SIMPEG El-Rahma provides a structured web-based solution with a clear
          and user-friendly interface. The system allows administrators and
          staff to manage employee data and documents efficiently, reducing
          manual work and improving data accessibility.
        </p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>
          This project helped me understand how to design a web-based
          information system tailored to institutional needs. I improved my
          ability to map business processes into structured user flows and
          design interfaces that support administrative efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also strengthened my skills in translating system requirements into
          clear UI components and organizing complex information into a
          user-friendly layout.
